# TheOnlyPot

#### Introduction
TheOnlyPot is an open-source cooking robot project aimed to automate the preparation of traditional Indian single-bowl dishes, such as khichdi, dal, and pulao, in the comfort of your home. Built with commercially available, off-the-shelf components, TheOnlyPot intends to use minimum custom parts, ensuring itâ€™s cost-effective, scalable, and easy to maintain. To be designed specifically for domestic use, TheOnlyPot will be compact and optimized to fit comfortably on an Indian kitchen countertop, making it ideal for home cooks. While users will need to chop and prepare ingredients beforehand, the robot handles key cooking tasks like stirring, heating, and seasoning. The project will also establish an open standard for creating and sharing recipes, enabling anyone to write, adapt, and share recipes in a standardized format that the robot can follow. Additionally, food safety standards will be considered to ensure hygienic and safe cooking practices, bringing both convenience and reliability to every meal.

## Contribute
I invite mechanical, electrical, computer-science enthusiasts, along with developers, makers, and food lovers and anyone else interested in the project to contribute their skills and ideas. Together, we can build and refine the system to ensure that cooking automation becomes accessible to all.

## To Do
### Planning & Research
- Research available open-source robotic platforms.
- Identify the key features and performance requirements.
- Define hardware and software requirements.
### Design & Prototyping
- **Hardware design:** Select electronics, sensors, valves, regulators, fitting & tubings etc.
- **Software Architecture:** Develop a modular architecture with components like motion control, sensor processing, recipe management, and user interaction. Design a simple UI to allow users to input recipes and interact with the robot.
- **Prototyping:** Build a small-scale prototype with basic functionality (e.g., robotic mechanics that can heat & stir). Integrate simple recipes that the robot can follow.
### Development
 - **Hardware Development:** Build the full-scale robot with actuators, sensors, and cooking appliances integrated into a unified system. Ensure safety mechanisms (e.g., temperature cutoffs, collision avoidance) are in place.
 - **Software Development:** Develop a recipe-following engine that can interpret ingredients and instructions (e.g., ingredient substitution, cooking adjustments). Implement real-time feedback and adjustments based on sensor input (e.g., if the food is overcooking).
 - **User Interface:** Develop an easy-to-use interface for recipe input and monitoring.
Optionally create mobile or web-based apps for remote control and monitoring.
 - **API and Open-Source Documentation:** Document the system architecture, software APIs, and user instructions. Provide clear guidance on how others can contribute to the project.
 - **Testing:** Test basic tasks like chopping, stirring, or following simple recipes.
Test cooking results for different recipes (taste, temperature, consistency).
### Beta Testing & Refinement
 - **Beta Release:** Share the first fully functional version with early adopters and the open-source community. Gather feedback from testers on both hardware performance (e.g., robotic movement) and software performance (e.g., recipe execution).
 - **Refinement:** Refine the hardware for precision and reliability. Optimize the software for better performance, especially recipe execution and real-time adjustments. Implement improvements based on community feedback (e.g., new recipes, better sensors, improved motion algorithms).
 - **Community Engagement:** Open channels for developers to contribute via GitHub, Slack, or forums.
