# TheOnlyPot

#### Introduction
TheOnlyPot is an open-source cooking robot project aimed to automate the preparation of traditional Indian single-bowl dishes, such as khichdi, dal, and pulao, in the comfort of your home. Built with commercially available, off-the-shelf components, TheOnlyPot intends to use minimum custom parts, ensuring itâ€™s cost-effective, scalable, and easy to maintain. To be designed specifically for domestic use, TheOnlyPot will be compact and optimized to fit comfortably on an Indian kitchen countertop, making it ideal for home cooks. While users will need to chop and prepare ingredients beforehand, the robot handles key cooking tasks like stirring, heating, and seasoning. The project will also establish an open standard for creating and sharing recipes, enabling anyone to write, adapt, and share recipes in a standardized format that the robot can follow. Additionally, food safety standards will be considered to ensure hygienic and safe cooking practices, bringing both convenience and reliability to every meal.
